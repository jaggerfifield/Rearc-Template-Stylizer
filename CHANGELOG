===== version 0.01

Added a line struct that holds the information about a line. We can render this struct to SDL_Points to be drawn to the screen. 

Added a key input handler, this is a strcut holding what keys are being pressed with bools.

Added a settings struct to hold vales that are referenced across the canvas.c file.

Added menu struct to have ui elements with buttons.

Menu rendering is using texture copy now.
